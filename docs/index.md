Welcome to the [Graft]() documentation homepage (written in, you guessed it,
[Graft]())!

[Graft]() is a preprocessor for [Forester]() allowing users to write their forests
using markdown and bibtex. Different markups and formats have slightly different
semantics in terms of the trees they generate. For more information, please refer
to their individual trees.

```forester
\put\transclude/expanded{false}
\transclude{graft-0001}
\transclude{graft-0002}
\transclude{graft-0006}
```
